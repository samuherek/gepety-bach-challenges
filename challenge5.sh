#Challenge 5: Loops
#Objective: Write a bash script that does the following:

#Create a loop that counts from 1 to 5.
#For each iteration, print "Iteration number [i]" where [i] is the current loop count.
#Hint: You can use a for loop in bash to accomplish this.


for i in {1..5}
do
    echo "Iteration number ${i}"
done
